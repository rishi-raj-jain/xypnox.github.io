Let me take this time. The time between what I will say later and when you started reading this, to delight that this text would take the place that lay empty for so long. And while I planned a different post to break this ice that has been frozen for about 3 years now, I don't think that post will make it in time. I am still learning about the topic I was writing about, while building the tools to write it with.

So for the meanwhile, let me revive the annual tradition that I _ended the year that I started it_. Of [tech](/blag/posts/tech-2020) and [culture](/blag/posts/culture-2020) recaps. But now I have to recap 3 years instead of 1 (but it serves me right). Both discussions on [Culture](#culture) and [Technology](#technology) have been combined in this single post. And the post has been hurried, for it needs no new ideas, or ways to show those ideas. And since it has been hurried, please be a little more lenient with the grammar. (I refuse to use any aid/helper tools apart from spellcheck)

# Culture

Firstly, I won't mention everything, the more curious can always scour my accounts [on Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/xypnox) for the books I read and [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/vm9mg8nzn3nqb3wyxcn8gyaac) for the songs I listen to.

And my tastes have not changed much. I still enjoy reading _fantasy, fiction, and classics_. And I still listen to a _broad variety of genres_, although I do have to admit I don't listen to songs as much as I used to.

## Books

## Music

It seems that the fortnightly playlists help a lot to mark when I first started to hear a song, and in these three years I have listened to a plenty of new sounds, and some noise as well.


I didn't attempt at a compilation for 2021, and so instead, here is the top songs of 2021, which has some decent bangers:

I made one half baked compilation for 2022, which I gave up on filtering and adding more. Unfortunately the more songs I listened to, the more there was to review, so much so that the review playlist I made to filter out the non obvious songs I had liked that year turned out to be 16 hours long. I listened to some of it on random but gave up and the rest is unfiltered still:

And the one I made for 2023:

## Covers

And naturally the covers of three years of Spotify playlists had accumulated, and I made a [covers page](/design/covers) earlier, where all of the covers can be browsed. 

Here are my favorites: 


<div style={{"--count": 3}}>
  <ImageGrid client:load images={coverData} />
</div>

## Games

As it is with a lot of hobbies or large fields, out of the dozen games that I purchased or acquired, I only really played 2, Counter Strike and the newest edition, Strike Force Heroes.

I played Forza 5 for a while on console and got pretty good at it. I could drive well with manual gear changes.

But most of my time gaming was dominated by Counter Strike. And I could write a few posts on why CS is so unique and engaging and what I like about it. Maybe I will, in the meantime, those who might want to play can request so on [my account]().

# Technology

It would be indeed a little overwhelming to note down everything I learned or created in the past 3 years.

In 2020 there used to be _a relatively normal social network where folks of tech could be found discussing, debating, learning and developing with each other_, and I enjoyed using that website. However, it is 2023, and that place is no more, but there is another that has taken its place. It is Mastodon. And what was true for the ozymandias of 2020 is true for Mastodon now.

Thus, I shifted to Mastodon as my primary social network, as in the one where the most "digital" time was spent. Those familiar with me and who used to follow me on the old network would have noticed/ignored my absence there since. And a mute blog with no updates doesn't help clarify that _all new info I was sharing was shared on my [Fosstodon account](https://elk.zone/fosstodon.org/@xypnox)_. Also, I use [Elk](https://elk.zone/) for browser and the default Android app on mobile.


## Two studios

I made two studios.

The first studio [xypnox.studio](https://xypnox.studio/) is a _interpretation of a digital workshop in the browser_, to experiment, and to build things that should be on the web, or a remedy of those that are riddled with inconsistent interface.

The second studio [x5z.studio](https://www.x5z.studio/), is a collaboration with Azil Zaneen, _a design studio for teams and startups looking for fast and quality design_, without the usual hassle. 

And to build both these websites, I used Astro and SolidJS, which leads to:

## Frontend

I tinkered with rich text editors, and theming.

I also got introduced to new frontend frameworks and libraries. I loved using [SolidJS]() and [Astro]() to build cool stuff, including this blog, a [ couple ](https://calry.app) of [ websites ](https://nirah.app) for startups.

I also really liked:

- [Lenis]() for smooth scrolling
- [Stores]() for handling state in SolidJS
- [Iconify Icons]() for adding icons to everything.
- [Responsive Typography]() for dynamic font sizes depending on the viewport.

I consider the following interesting:

- [Phind]() for searching about bugs/issues/tech related queries.
- [Bing Image Creator]() to generate free images via Dall-E.
- []() 

## PC

I built a new PC at the start of 2023, and it has lasted the year well. Here are the specs:

```js
 xypnox@btlstn-1-xypnox
 ----------------------
 OS: EndeavourOS Linux x86_64
 Shell: zsh 5.9
 Resolution: 2560x1440, 2560x1440
 WM: i3
 Theme: Nordic-darker-v40 [GTK2/3]
 Terminal: alacritty
 CPU: 13th Gen Intel i7-13700K (24) @ 5.3GHz
 GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Lite Hash Rate
 Memory: 32GB
```

I dualboot on this machine, with Windows 11 designated as the Gaming OS and the rest of everything handled by EndeavourOS.

After using a ton of Mac devices, returning back to i3 window manager was a bliss. The splits and shortcuts and the ease were all what they used to be, fast efficient and out of the way. Indeed it took time to get it to set up properly, and there are things I still want to change, but the current setup works nicely, and fits like a glove.
