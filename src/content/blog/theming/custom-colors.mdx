## Only prefers color scheme

1. Perhaps if you have managed to make the dark theme, tying it only to the prefers color scheme option feels kinda bad. Having the ability is cool, but the inability for the user to select the theme they want instead of forcing them to switch the theme for the entire system is kinda bad.

# Living in the dark mode

Not all dark modes have to be built, some can be applied, because the light mode already contains a lot of information to convert itself to dark mode.


- Dark Reader extension converts light mode websites to dark mode
- Stylus allows setting custom stylesheets on specific websites, in combination with websites that have a good css variable declaration, a simple changes can be made that will be retained (hopefully) till the next overhaul.
