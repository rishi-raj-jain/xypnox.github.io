Dark mode is _a different stylistic version of the same interface_, and uses lighter colors on top of darker background. There should be _no change_ in layout. Any changes that could be done to the layout should work in both modes.

Some things remained dark, some turned towards light like the web browser with the default white background. And the bright themes of the operating systems. 

Dark mode has now become a staple in modern interfaces. Mainstream apps, government websites, and operating systems all have dark modes now, and I prefer them over the harsh white, however ugly they may be.

_But does everything need a dark mode? And can everything be turned dark?_

# Is it needed?

Dark mode is cool'n'all but does it make sense in your situation? The question we must understand is _whether mode switching is necessary or not_. Whether a single mode, light or dark, makes more sense than adding the option to switch modes.

{/* The point of having modes and the ability to switch between them is directly dependent on the content that is being presented. Not everything needs to be switchable, between light and the dark.*/}

Whether one should have a dark mode depends on what one wants to show, i.e. it depends on the _content_ being shown. And to whom it is being shown to, and for what purpose. (The _context_)

{/* Power savings aside, */}
I consider the best place for dark mode are _frequently used_ applications, and those that put focus on the content more. Applications are opened more frequently and people spend more time with their interface than normal websites. _Complex editors_ - both text and graphic - want to focus on the thing being edited rather than the editor itself. Moreover larger color variations can be used with code highlights in dark mode.

Moreover, for applications _usability trumps any branding specific design implementations_. Brands, companies, etc are more targeted towards conveying a distinct and unique identity, where uniqueness can sometimes trump usability (in the sense of not following the standard layouts). And that brand is represented on their digital interfaces of websites and apps.

If more people who use the software prefer the dark mode, think whether it is necessary to have a light mode. How about just the dark mode? 

There are arguments from research about how the black on white background (light mode) is easier on the eyes for reading, but in my case, I have developed a fondness with dark mode after several years of usage. And hence I like to interact with interfaces in dark mode.

# The conversion

After considering the content and the context, if dark mode is indeed what we want, we can use one of the most common methods of converting a light mode to a dark mode. Simply _switch the background and text colors_.

<ThemePreviewSplits
  client:visible
  {...themePreviewSplitsConfigs.bnw}
  previews={[
  {
    vars: { txt: "#000", bg: "#fff", },
    elements: [
      {
        type: "h1",
        text: "Black & White",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        text: "Black letters look thin as white light bleeds into the black lines, also things appear light and airy"
      },
    ]
  },

  {
    vars: { txt: "#fff", bg: "#000", },
    elements: [
      {
        type: "h1",
        text: "Black & White",
      },
      {
        type: "text",
        text: "White letters bleed light onto the black background making text appear thicker. Consider also that this black is currently inside a dark blog.",

      },
    ]
  }

  ]}
/>

While this serves for basic text only content, there are various elements that don't directly translate into a usable dark mode.

## Colors

### Relative colors

Although an explanation about how the _perceived colors depend on the background_ is not needed, here is a fine example:

<ThemePreviewSplits
  client:visible
  previews={[
    {
      vars: {
        txt: '#333',
        surface: '#fff',
        primary: {
          color: '#447DEB',
          over: '#fff'
        },
        bg: '#EBEDF2',
      },
      elements: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Notice the color blue' },
        { type: 'button', text: 'Bluuue' },
        { type: 'card', text: 'This is our benchmark' },
      ]
    },
    {
      vars: {
        txt: '#eee',
        surface: '#20202f',
        primary: {
          color: '#447DEB',
          over: '#fff'
        },
        bg: '#0f0f1f',
      },
      elements: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Now a direct conversion' },
        { type: 'button', text: 'Bluuue' },
        { type: 'card', text: 'See how this doesn\'t match' },
        { type: 'text', text: 'Even though its the exact same hex code.' },
      ]
    },
    {
      vars: {
        txt: '#eee',
        surface: '#20202f',
        primary: {
          color: '#2A5EC3',
          over: '#fff'
        },
        bg: '#0f0f1f',
      },
      elements: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'A little adjustment' },
        { type: 'button', text: 'Bluuue' },
        { type: 'card', text: 'To the color makes it match the color in light mode.' },
      ]
    },
  ]}

### The ugly gray

One of the easiest ways to make a dark mode color palette is to pick shades of gray. And they are easy to pick in all color formats.

However, the interfaces that use such gray shades look dull and washed out. Desaturated. As if someone disabled the app itself instead of a button. Especially if [combined with material design (v2)](https://m2.material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#properties).

<ThemePreviewSplits
  client:visible
  previews={[
    {
      vars: {
        txt: '#eee',
        surface: '#333',
        bg: '#222',
      },
      elements: [
        { type: 'h2', text: 'Gray is static, gray is ugly' },
        { type: 'card', text: 'Gray on gray is uglier still' },
        { type: 'text', text: 'Through years of experience I can say, gray is grey, gray and darkgray and lightgray and dark all at the same time.' },
      ]
    },
    {
      vars: {
        txt: '#eee',
        surface: '#333',
        bg: '#111',
      },
      elements: [
        { type: 'h1', text: 'A little darker?' },
        { type: 'h2', text: 'We might as well have used black' },
        { type: 'card', text: 'And the surfaces are still ugly' }
      ]
    },
    {
      vars: {
        txt: "#B5C0DB",
        bg: "#1A1E27",
        surface: "#303748",
      },
      elements: [
        { type: 'h1', text: 'Adding a bit of color' },
        { type: 'card', text: 'Adds a lot of life that was missing' },
        { type: 'text', text: 'In these drab slabs of gray' }
      ]
    },
    {
      vars: {
        txt: "#B5C0DB",
        bg: "#0f111a",
        surface: "#1A1E27",
      },
      elements: [
        { type: 'h1', text: 'And we can always go darker still' },
        { type: 'text', text: 'Though the effect is not as pronounced' },
        { type: 'card', text: 'Yet it is good enough' }
      ]
    },
  ]}

/>

And I think these gray themes are what have given the dark mode the aura of unsaturated monochromatic soulless interfaces. As if colors are meant to be reserved for the light mode.

## Colors that were lost

Some colors look bad on white background if used as text. Yellow is a prime example. But in the world of dark mode, yellow literally shines!

<ThemePreviewSplits
  client:visible
  previews={[
    {
      vars: {
        txt: 'yellow',
        bg: '#fff',
      },
      elements: [
        { type: 'h1', text: 'Yellow in dark mode is more readable' },
        { type: 'h2', text: 'than the light mode' },
      ]
    },
    {
      vars: {
        txt: "yellow",
        bg: "#0f111a",
      },
      elements: [
        { type: 'h1', text: 'Yellow in dark mode is more readable' },
        { type: 'h2', text: 'than the light mode' },
      ]
    },
  ]}
  showInfo={false}
/>

## Surfaces

Another dilemma arises when we have a background and a card, there are several _ways to differentiate the background with the foreground_.

In the light mode, we can enjoy a variety of styles to separate content into boxes.

<ThemePreviewSplits
  client:visible
  previews={[
      {
        vars: themePreviewConfigVars.lightModeShadowCardVars,
        elements: [
          { type: 'card', text: 'A shadow on a box is universally exploited as a card. It adds the perception of depth.' },
      ],},
      { vars: themePreviewConfigVars.lightModeCardVars,
        elements: [
          { type: 'card', text: 'A lighter background can look as if it is ahead of a darker background even though there are no shadows.' },
      ],},
      { vars: themePreviewConfigVars.lightModeCardFlippedVars,
        elements: [
          { type: 'card', text: 'A darker background can mean anything, from simple info to notifications, buttons and disabled elements as well.' },
      ],},
      { vars: themePreviewConfigVars.lightModeCardBorderVars,
        elements: [
          { type: 'card', text: 'A border can be a box if the design system decides it is so, and it can also be used as input.' },
      ],},
  ]}
/>

<ThemePreviewSplits
  client:visible
  {...themePreviewSplitsConfigs.card}
/>

### Shadows

Natural looking shadows are easy in light mode as there is ample contrast from the lighter background for a faint shadow to be visible, however in dark mode, the shadow opacity and darkness has to be turned all the way up. Sometimes a glow is added instead as it matches the dark metaphor.


<ThemePreviewSplits
  client:visible
  previews={[
      {
        vars: themePreviewConfigVars.lightModeShadowCardVars,
        elements: [
          { type: 'card', text: 'This shadow looks fine, like a normal card would make.' },
      ],},
      {
        vars: themePreviewConfigVars.darkModeShadowCardVars,
        elements: [
          { type: 'card', text: 'Notice how the same shadow is barely visible in dark mode' },
      ],},
      {
        vars: themePreviewConfigVars.darkModeSharpShadowCardVars,
        elements: [
          { type: 'card', text: 'But once we pump up the shadow opacity we get similar contrast.' },
      ],},
      {
        vars: themePreviewConfigVars.darkModeGlowCardVars,
        elements: [
          { type: 'card', text: 'A bit of glow, but it can sometimes become too harsh.' },
      ],},
  ]}
/>

### Shiny

A shiny look can be implemented by replicating the characteristics of the light reflections via a gradient border and background.

An example of the current shiny look: 

<ThemePreview
  client:visible
  preview={{
        vars: themePreviewConfigVars.shinyCardVars,
        elements: [
          { type: 'shinycard', text: '',
            elements: [
              { type: 'h1', text: 'SaaS AI' },
              { type: 'text', text: 'Get that latest SaaS AI Sauce sources via Safe Secure Shoutouts' },
              { type: 'button', text: 'Subscribe.AI' },

            ]
          },
      ],}
  }
/>



## The code block

What color mode should the code block be in?

Should light mode and dark mode both have different color schemes? What if your light mode already has a dark code highlighting? Does this mean we add a light code highlighting theme for dark mode?

## Contrasty design

There are designs for software (websites, products) that use different modes (dark/light) in the same interface to distinguish a sidebar/navigation/sections of a page.

Ex: Sidebar with black back and white text beside a product dashboard, a website with dark and light sections in the landing page.

While this is effective to some degree. It is neither dark nor light. And the contrast is needless in most cases. Why would you use a different mode when a border or a slightly different shade of background could have achieved the same? Is it because of a "brand identity"? But even then, what kind of brand is both dark and light and that at the same time?


## Only prefers color scheme

1. Perhaps if you have managed to make the dark theme, tying it only to the prefers color scheme option feels kinda bad. Having the ability is cool, but the inability for the user to select the theme they want instead of forcing them to switch the theme for the entire system is kinda bad.

# Living in the dark mode

Not all dark modes have to be built, some can be applied, because the light mode already contains a lot of information to convert itself to dark mode.


- Dark Reader extension converts light mode websites to dark mode
- Stylus allows setting custom stylesheets on specific websites, in combination with websites that have a good css variable declaration, a simple changes can be made that will be retained (hopefully) till the next overhaul.
