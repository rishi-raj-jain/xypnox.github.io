<ColorPoem poem={
`Water under the bridge
  is tumbling in a river
Save the ones still swimming

For the ones that have sunk
  will never float again
  will be lost in eternity

And the ice that formed
  in the lake the river is from
  shatters with every wave
And slices through the bodies
  of those still floating

And the blood turns
  the river red
