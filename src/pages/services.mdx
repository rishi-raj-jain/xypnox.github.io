I generalize in programming and specialize in the design of interfaces.

Thus I provide the following services on a freelance/contractual basis:

- **Design**
  I design stuff. Like a lot of web stuff but more than that, ex: Slides, Docs, Invitations, Covers, etc etc.

- **Web Dev**
  I can help you build web projects, usually portfolios, blogs, websites etc.

- **Design Review** [^1]
  I review your website/product/branding or any digital artifact and provide constructive feedback on styling, layouts, usability.
  This need not be just a web thing, for example I can also review 

- **Dev**
  Although by niche is in websites, I have also explored development in various areas, so I can also help you in general development. For example of bots, automations, scrapping, programmatic generations etc.

## Price

Can you put a price on it?
If you can do share with me. If you can't here is how I think the services should be priced.



## Interested?

I can be reached via [xypnox@gmail.com](mailto:xypnox@gmail.com), also I am quite responsive on telegram.

[^1]: Although it should be UI/UX review, but I find issues in those terms, thus, Design Review.
