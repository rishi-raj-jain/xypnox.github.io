> Is it a question? To me? Or just the meaning of the text "xypnox"?

Following are the benefits of choosing it:

- Is short enough
- And it was available
- Is unique enough
- Was available in several places
- Because it can be pronounced
- Did I mention it was available?
- Looks good as text ( xypnox ) somewhat symmetric

Needless to say, it indeed was available and that was the best reason.

## Meaning

The Greek word that I finally stumbled upon was έξυπνος (éxypnos). It means smart, clever, ingenious etc in English. Perfect! But the e in the beginning wasn't too nice. So, I removed the e and It now also meant Awake! Obviously, xypnos was already taken on Gmail. So, I had to improvise again. This time removing the last letter and replacing it with the good old x. And xypnox was finalized.

## The logo/icon/wordmark/favicon/symbol/graph

History of the icon.

From the very beginning to variations to a reset to now.

<div style={{"--count": 3}}>

  ].map(( s, i ) => ({
  url: s,
  thumbnail: s,
  title: i,
  alt: s,
  link: s,
  }))} />
</div>

As is obvious from the variations, the shape is malleable.

I use several variants of the current shape/form in different places. The ones shown above are the ones I liked at that time.
